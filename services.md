# Services

Arboricultural consultancy and reporting require up-to-date understanding of arboricultural science. To meet our clientsâ€™ needs, our arborists have acquired a Diploma, AQF Level 5, as their base knowledge, and together we have over 80 years of industry experience.

Arbor Australis Consulting has been established and developed to deliver independent arboricultural consultation to all markets. Our services range from domestic tree assessments to large-scale tree audits and infrastructure management plans. We aim to provide accurate and informed opinions that assist our clients in managing tree issues. 

Arbor Australis Consulting frequently utilises technology such as GIS (Geographic Information System) mapping to maximise efficiency and deliver products that meet our clients' needs. We aim to provide most services in-house, however, we utilise allied professionals to boost our product delivery and specific requirements, such as GIS specialists, fauna spotters, ecologists and botanists. 

When you engage Arbor Australis Consulting for your project, the delivery of services will be tailored to your project. Our team will deliver the required reporting in the agreed time frame and keep you informed throughout the project.

<p>
  Developments often require an Arboricultural Impact Assessment (AIA) that complies with AS 4970 -2009 "Protection of trees on development sites". Engaging an Arboricultural Consultant to provide the tree data is part of developing a resolution.
</p>

<p>
  Arbor Australis Consulting has a track record of delivering assessments and complete reporting packages that meet the requirements of local authorities.
</p>

<p>
  We provide clear communication during the development of site-focused reporting that is easy to understand.
</p>

<p>
  All of our consultants meet the minimum AQF level 5 qualification (AQF Level 5) required to deliver assessment, reporting and supervision of work around trees. We provide practical solutions to issues that arise and proactively look for resolutions.

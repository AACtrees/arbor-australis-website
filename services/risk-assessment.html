<p>Our AQF Level 5 Consulting Arborists are licensed and trained users of the Quantiﬁed Tree Risk Assessment (QTRA), the Tree Risk Assessment Qualiﬁcation (TRAQ) and VALID tree risk assessment methodologies. Tree risk assessments form an integral part of our everyday operations, assisting in the identiﬁcation, assessment and quantiﬁcation of risks in trees.</p>

<p>We will listen to clients' concerns about tree risk and, through tested methodologies, apply a robust risk assessment to clarify actual risk rather than perceived risk.</p>

<p>From these assessments, recommendations are made to manage risk, and a written report is provided to support all findings.</p>
